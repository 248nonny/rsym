Determining whether the antiderivative of a given expression can be represented by elementary functions (i.e., combinations of polynomials, rational functions, exponentials, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and their inverses) is a nuanced task. There isn't a simple rule that always applies, but there are several approaches you can use:

### 1. **Look for Standard Forms**

- **Polynomials**: If the integrand is a polynomial or a rational function, its antiderivative is often elementary (i.e., it can be expressed in terms of polynomials or logarithms).
- **Rational functions**: If the integrand is a rational function (a ratio of two polynomials), check if it can be simplified (e.g., by partial fraction decomposition) to a form where elementary functions are possible.
- **Exponential and Trigonometric Functions**: If the integrand involves exponential or trigonometric functions, you might have a chance of obtaining an elementary antiderivative, especially if the argument of the function is simple.

### 2. **Check for Standard Integration Techniques**

- Use standard integration techniques like **substitution**, **integration by parts**, **trigonometric identities**, or **partial fractions** to see if an elementary antiderivative emerges. If it does, the antiderivative is elementary.
- If these techniques don't lead to a simple result, it could indicate the absence of an elementary antiderivative.

### 3. **Apply the Risch Algorithm**

The **Risch Algorithm** is a decision procedure that determines whether the indefinite integral of a given function can be expressed in terms of elementary functions. It involves examining the structure of the integrand and applying a series of rules and heuristics.

- If the integral can be computed by the Risch algorithm, it has an elementary antiderivative.
- If the algorithm concludes that the integral cannot be expressed in elementary terms, then it does not have an elementary antiderivative.

The Risch algorithm is implemented in symbolic computation tools like Mathematica, Maple, and some CAS systems in Python (e.g., SymPy).

### 4. **Liouville’s Theorem (for rational functions of elementary functions)**

Liouville's Theorem provides a more rigorous criterion for the integrability of certain functions. Specifically, it says that the integral of a function involving elementary functions is elementary only if the integrand can be written in a specific form (often involving rational functions of elementary functions).

In simple terms:

- If an integral can be expressed as a sum of elementary functions, it must satisfy certain relationships (based on algebraic manipulation) that are checked using the structure of the integrand.
- If these relationships can't be satisfied, the integral does not have an elementary antiderivative.

### 5. **Non-Elementary Integrals**

Certain integrals are known to be **non-elementary** (i.e., they can't be expressed with elementary functions), even though they can be represented in other forms. Some examples include:

- The **error function** erf(x)erf(x), related to ∫e−x2 dx∫e−x2dx.
- ∫ex2 dx∫ex2dx, which doesn't have an elementary antiderivative.
- ∫sin⁡(x)x dx∫xsin(x)​dx, known as the sine integral, Si(x)Si(x).

In these cases, symbolic computation tools may express the result in terms of special functions, indicating that an elementary form does not exist.

### 6. **Use Computational Tools**

Symbolic computation tools can help automate the process of checking whether an integral is elementary:

- **Mathematica**: It has a built-in `Integrate` function that attempts to find elementary antiderivatives. If it can't find one, it will often express the result using special functions.
- **Maple**: Like Mathematica, it can attempt to find elementary integrals, or indicate if the result is non-elementary.
- **SymPy** (Python): A symbolic math library with the `integrate` function that may help identify if the integral has an elementary solution.

### 7. **Look for Known Non-Elementary Integrals**

Over time, certain integrals have been shown to be non-elementary, and these are often documented in integral tables or references like:

- **Gradshteyn and Ryzhik**
- **Table of Integrals, Series, and Products** by I.S. Gradshteyn and I.M. Ryzhik.
- **Integral tables**: Some integrals have been proven to be non-elementary and are often expressed in terms of special functions.

### Summary:

- If the integral is relatively simple and involves basic functions like polynomials, rational functions, exponentials, and trigonometric functions, it's likely to have an elementary antiderivative.
- If standard methods don't yield a result, or if you recognize the form of a non-elementary integral, the integral may not have an elementary solution.
- The **Risch Algorithm** and tools like **Mathematica** and **Maple** can assist in making this determination in more complex cases.
